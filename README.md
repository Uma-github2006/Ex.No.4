## CHATGPT

## 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

### Definition:
A comparative analysis prompt asks the AI to compare two or more concepts, highlighting their similarities and differences. It is useful when we need to evaluate alternatives.

### Prompt :
“Compare IoT-enabled predictive maintenance with traditional manual maintenance in manufacturing. Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case:
This helps companies decide whether to invest in IoT-based predictive maintenance or continue with manual monitoring by clearly understanding trade-offs like cost, downtime, and efficiency.

## 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

### Definition:
An experiential perspective prompt asks the AI to respond from a particular role or viewpoint (e.g., manager, student, engineer). This makes the answer more practical and relatable.

### Prompt :
“As a factory manager, explain how IoT-based automation can improve production efficiency and reduce downtime in your plant.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case:
This helps companies decide whether to invest in IoT-based predictive maintenance or continue with manual monitoring by clearly understanding trade-offs like cost, downtime, and efficiency.

## 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

### Definition:
Everyday functioning prompts connect technical concepts with daily life, making them easier to understand by linking with familiar examples.

### Prompt :
“Describe how IoT automation in manufacturing is similar to using smart home devices like Alexa or smart refrigerators.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case:
This makes IoT in factories easier to understand for employees by comparing it to familiar smart devices, helping with training and awareness.

## 4. Universal Prompt Structures

### Definition:
Universal prompt structures are general templates that can be reused for any concept. They often include “Explain in simple terms” or “Step by step explanation.”

### Prompt :
“Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example from a car manufacturing plant.
Explain the process of IoT-based real-time monitoring step by step.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case:
This ensures that complex manufacturing automation concepts are broken into simple, step-by-step explanations for engineers and trainees.

## 5. Prompt Size Limitations

### Definition:
Prompt size limitations occur when the task is too large for a single prompt. The solution is to break it into smaller, manageable chunks.

### Prompt :
“List 5 benefits of IoT in manufacturing automation. Then, in the next step, expand each benefit into a detailed explanation.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case:
This allows large reports, such as detailed IoT benefits or predictive maintenance strategies, to be explained gradually without overwhelming the system or the reader.

## GEMINI

## 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

### Definition: 
Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts, often highlighting similarities and differences.

### Example Prompt: 
"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."

### 
Application to Manufacturing Use Case: "Compare and contrast the use of predictive maintenance based on machine learning models versus a traditional time-based maintenance schedule for manufacturing equipment. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach in terms of cost, downtime, and operational efficiency, specifically for an automotive assembly line."

## 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
### Definition: 
Requesting a response from a specific point of view or professional role.

### Example Prompt:
“As a software engineer, what are the benefits of using cloud computing in your projects?”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case: 
"Imagine you are a plant manager at a food processing factory. Describe the biggest challenges you face with machinery downtime and how a new IoT-based predictive maintenance system would impact your daily operations and decision-making. What are your primary concerns and expectations?"

## 3. Everyday Functioning Prompts
### Definition:
Describing the role of a complex technology in a simple, relatable, or daily context.

### Example Prompt: 
“Describe the role of machine learning in everyday apps like YouTube or Netflix."

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case: 
"Describe how an embedded controller in a single piece of manufacturing equipment, like a robotic arm, uses real-time data from an IoT sensor to adjust its speed and torque to prevent a defect, similar to how a thermostat in a home adjusts temperature."

## 4. Universal Prompt Structures Prompt Refinements
### Definition: 
Using a standard, well-defined prompt structure and refining it to be specific to the task at hand.

### Example Prompt:
^ “Explain [concept] in simple terms with an example.” ^ “Explain the process of [task] step by step.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case: 
"Explain the process of implementing a real-time monitoring system for a production line, step-by-step. Start from the installation of sensors, to data collection, and finally to the use of a centralized dashboard for real-time analysis."

## 5. Prompt Size Limitations
### Definition:
Dealing with the constraint that AI models may not be able to process or generate very long, complex requests in a single response, requiring the user to break them into smaller, manageable chunks.

### Example Prompt: 
“Translate this 5000-word essay into Tamil.” → Manageable chunks: “Translate the first 1000 words into Tamil, then continue.”

### Application to Manufacturing Use Case (Refined/Manageable Chunks):

Initial Large Prompt: "Provide a comprehensive, detailed technical plan for an IoT-based automation system for a large-scale electronics manufacturing plant. Include specifications for all hardware (sensors, controllers), software (SCADA, HMI, cloud platform), networking protocols, data security measures, and a phased implementation strategy over 2 years, including budget estimates and ROI calculations."
